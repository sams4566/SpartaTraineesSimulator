# Sparta Trainees Simulator Project
## Description
The Sparta Trainees Simulator keeps track of the people currently training. It generates trainees each month and they get places in different training centres: training hubs, boot camp centres and tech centres. It generates a CSV file containing a forecast about the number of trainees and training centres based on the chosen number of years.
